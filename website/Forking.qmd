## Making changes as someone else's repository

In the previous section, we made changes to our own repository and we were able to accept the changes ourselves because we are owner of the repository.

## Forking a repository

In order to make changes to someone else's repository you have to get rights for the repository. On Github, this means that you make a copy of the repository under your account. This process is called **forking** a repository.

> Challenge: Contribute to someone else's repository.

Navigate to the repository https://github.com/likeajumprope/Git_course. This repository is owned by me, so you are not the owner of the repository and you won't be able to make changes right away.

1 Click on the fork button on on the main page of the repository. You need to be logged into your github account to create a fork.

You can leave everything the way git suggests it for now. Click create repository.

A fork of the repository should now appear under your account name. You should also still see the original repository. I have added here a picture of a repository that I have forked into my account:

Now go to the add file tab. Click on it and select Add new file.
