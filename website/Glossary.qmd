## Branch

An identical copy of a repository. Branches are great to test features before pushing them into the main branch.

## .gitignore file

A file containing the name of all files, folders etc that should not be tracked. Lives in the root directory of your repo. Wildcards are allowed, for example \*.png excludes all png files.

## Issue

GitHub Issues allows you to create text-based descriptions of tasks, bugs, changes, and allow you to update your repository and document changes, It is also a way to communicate with other developers.

## Origin repository

Your fork of a repository - the clone of the repository under your account.

## Pull request (PR) 

Pull requests tell others about the changes that you have made and pushed to a repository. Once the PR is opened, it is good practise to discuss and review the changes with other developers.

## Upstream repository
