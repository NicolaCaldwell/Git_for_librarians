## A hypothetical scenario

Git is really good at tracking changes made to documents as they move through time. Optimally, each version should fall into place somewhere in the linear history of the document. However, there are situations where versions conflict and it isn't clear what version of a document is the most recent version.

## 

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
